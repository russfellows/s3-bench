# Prepare & Cleanup Stage Performance Fix - v0.5.4

## Problem Discovery

During testing with Google Cloud Storage (GCS), both the **prepare** and **cleanup** stages were taking unexpectedly long times. Investigation revealed that both functions were executing operations **sequentially** in simple for loops:

```rust
// OLD CODE - Sequential Execution (SLOW)

// PREPARE STAGE:
for i in 0..to_create {
    let uri = format!("{}/{:012}.bin", base_uri.trim_end_matches('/'), i);
    let size = thread_rng().gen_range(min_size..=max_size);
    let data = Bytes::from(generate_data(size, fill_type));
    
    store.put(&Path::from(uri), data).await?;  // ❌ Waiting for each PUT to complete
    pb.inc(1);
}

// CLEANUP STAGE:
for (i, obj) in objects.iter().enumerate() {
    if obj.created {
        let store = create_store_for_uri(&obj.uri)?;
        if let Err(e) = store.delete(&obj.uri).await {  // ❌ One at a time!
            tracing::warn!("Failed to delete {}: {}", obj.uri, e);
        }
    }
    pb.inc(1);
}
```

This meant that operations were being executed **one at a time**, which is extremely inefficient for I/O-bound operations.

## Performance Impact

### Before Fix (Sequential):
- **Prepare**: Estimated ~400-600 objects/sec
  - 20,000 objects would take ~35-50 seconds
- **Cleanup**: Estimated ~400-600 objects/sec  
  - 2,000 objects would take ~3-5 seconds

### After Fix (32 Workers):
- **Prepare**:
  - Small objects (100 KiB): **13,179-18,677 objects/sec** (30x improvement)
  - Large objects (1 MiB): **788 objects/sec at 788 MB/sec throughput**
  - 20,000 objects (1 MiB each): **25.4 seconds** vs estimated 50+ seconds
- **Cleanup**:
  - Small objects (100 KiB): **>10,000 objects/sec** (30x improvement)
  - 2,000 objects: **< 0.2 seconds** vs estimated 3-5 seconds
  - 5,000 objects: **< 0.3 seconds** vs estimated 7-12 seconds

## Solution Implementation

Converted both `prepare_objects()` and `cleanup_prepared_objects()` to use **parallel async execution** with semaphore-controlled concurrency, matching the pattern used in the main workload execution:

### Prepare Stage - Parallel Pattern

```rust
// NEW CODE - Parallel Execution with 32 Workers (FAST)
use futures::stream::{FuturesUnordered, StreamExt};
use tokio::sync::Semaphore;

// Pre-generate all tasks (URIs and sizes)
let tasks: Vec<(String, u64)> = (0..to_create)
    .map(|i| {
        let uri = format!("{}/{:012}.bin", base_uri.trim_end_matches('/'), i);
        let size = thread_rng().gen_range(min_size..=max_size);
        (uri, size)
    })
    .collect();

// Execute with 32 parallel workers
let sem = Arc::new(Semaphore::new(32));
let mut futs = FuturesUnordered::new();

for (uri, size) in tasks {
    let store = Arc::clone(&store);
    let pb = pb.clone();
    let sem2 = Arc::clone(&sem);
    let fill_type = spec.fill;

    futs.push(tokio::spawn(async move {
        let _permit = sem2.acquire_owned().await.unwrap();  // ✅ Semaphore controls concurrency
        let data = Bytes::from(generate_data(size, fill_type));
        let result = store.put(&Path::from(uri), data).await;
        pb.inc(1);
        result
    }));
}

// Collect all results
while let Some(res) = futs.next().await {
    res.context("Task panicked")??;
}
```

### Cleanup Stage - Parallel Pattern

```rust
// NEW CODE - Parallel Execution with 32 Workers (FAST)
use futures::stream::{FuturesUnordered, StreamExt};
use tokio::sync::Semaphore;

let concurrency = 32;
let sem = Arc::new(Semaphore::new(concurrency));
let mut futs = FuturesUnordered::new();

for obj in to_delete {
    let sem2 = sem.clone();
    let uri = obj.uri.clone();
    
    futs.push(tokio::spawn(async move {
        let _permit = sem2.acquire_owned().await.unwrap();
        
        // Intentionally don't fail entire cleanup on single delete failure
        match create_store_for_uri(&uri) {
            Ok(store) => {
                if let Err(e) = store.delete(&uri).await {
                    tracing::warn!("Failed to delete {}: {}", uri, e);
                }
            }
            Err(e) => {
                tracing::warn!("Failed to create store for {}: {}", uri, e);
            }
        }
    }));
}

// Wait for all deletion tasks to complete
while let Some(res) = futs.next().await {
    if let Err(e) = res {
        tracing::error!("Cleanup task panicked: {}", e);
    }
}
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **32 Workers**: Matches the default `concurrency` setting in config files, ensuring consistent parallelism across prepare, workload, and cleanup stages.

2. **Semaphore Pattern**: Uses `Arc<Semaphore>` to limit concurrent tasks, preventing unbounded spawning that could exhaust system resources.

3. **FuturesUnordered**: Efficiently polls all active futures, starting new tasks as soon as a slot becomes available.

4. **Pre-generation (Prepare)**: URIs and sizes are generated upfront in a single loop, then distributed to worker tasks. This separates data generation from I/O execution.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - **Prepare**: Any PUT failure stops the prepare stage immediately (propagates errors)
   - **Cleanup**: Individual delete failures are logged but don't stop cleanup (best-effort deletion)

| Stage | Test Scenario | Object Count | Object Size | Time | Throughput (obj/s) | Throughput (MB/s) |
|-------|---------------|--------------|-------------|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Prepare** | Small baseline | 1,000 | 100 KiB | 0.076s | 13,179 | 1,286 |
| **Prepare** | Medium load | 5,000 | 100 KiB | 0.269s | 18,677 | 1,823 |
| **Prepare** | Large production | 20,000 | 1 MiB | 25.376s | 788 | 788 |

## Impact on Cloud Backends

These fixes are **critical** for cloud storage benchmarking where network latency makes sequential execution especially painful:

- **GCS**: High latency (~100-300ms per operation) → parallel execution essential
- **S3**: Moderate latency (~50-150ms) → significant speedup  
- **Azure**: High latency (~200-500ms) → dramatic improvement

With 32 parallel workers, both prepare and cleanup stages can now saturate network bandwidth and handle the latency overhead efficiently.

## Code Location

**Commit**: (pending)

## Regression Testing

The test configurations in `tests/configs/prepare-performance/` and `tests/configs/cleanup-performance/` should be used for regression testing to ensure both prepare and cleanup stage performance remains optimal across future changes:

```bash
# Prepare stage tests
./target/release/sai3-bench run --config tests/configs/prepare-performance/test-1k.yaml
./target/release/sai3-bench run --config tests/configs/prepare-performance/test-20k-1mb.yaml
./target/release/sai3-bench run --config tests/configs/prepare-performance/test-full-workflow.yaml

# Cleanup stage tests
./target/release/sai3-bench run --config tests/configs/cleanup-performance/test-cleanup-2k.yaml
./target/release/sai3-bench run --config tests/configs/cleanup-performance/test-cleanup-5k.yaml

# Automated test script
./tests/configs/cleanup-performance/test-cleanup.sh
```

**Expected baseline performance (file:// backend):**
- **Prepare**: >10,000 obj/sec for small objects, >700 obj/sec for 1MB objects
- **Cleanup**: >10,000 obj/sec for small objects

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding a `prepare_concurrency` configuration option to allow independent control of prepare stage parallelism:

```yaml
prepare:
  concurrency: 64  # Optional override for prepare stage
  ensure_objects:
    - base_uri: "s3://bucket/data/"
      count: 50000
      # ...
```

This would allow tuning for different backend characteristics without affecting workload concurrency.
