# v0.6.9 Benchmark: Read 1TB using buffered file:// (paged I/O)
# Tests traditional buffered reads through page cache
# Usage: sai3-bench run --config v069_benchmark_read_buffered.yaml
#
# This reads the 262,144 files generated by v069_benchmark_prepare.yaml
# using standard buffered I/O (file://) which uses the OS page cache.
# Expected: Good performance due to caching effects

target: "file:///tmp/sai3bench-v069-1tb/"
duration: 300s  # 5 minutes - adjust based on expected throughput
concurrency: 64  # Match typical async I/O depth

# Optimize page cache for sequential access (2-3x performance improvement)
# Sequential mode enables aggressive prefetching and large readahead
page_cache_mode: sequential

workload:
  - op: get
    path: "data/*"  # Read all generated files
    weight: 100

# No prepare or cleanup - files should already exist from prepare step
