# io-bench: Multi-Protocol I/O Benchmarking Suite

A comprehensive storage performance testing tool that supports multiple backends through a unified interface. Built on the [s3dlio Rust library](https://github.com/russfellows/s3dlio) for robust multi-protocol support.

## ðŸš€ What Makes io-bench Different?

1. **Multi-Protocol Support**: Unlike tools that focus on a single protocol, io-bench supports 4 storage backends
2. **Unified Interface**: Consistent CLI and configuration across all storage types  
3. **Advanced Metrics**: Microsecond-precision HDR histogram performance measurements
4. **Distributed Execution**: gRPC-based agent/controller architecture for scale testing
5. **Workload Replay**: Support for captured workload replay and analysis
6. **Real-World Patterns**: Glob patterns, concurrent operations, and mixed workloads

## ðŸŽ¯ Supported Storage Backends

- **File System** (`file://`) - Local filesystem testing with standard POSIX operations
- **Direct I/O** (`direct://`) - High-performance direct I/O for maximum throughput
- **Amazon S3** (`s3://`) - S3 and S3-compatible storage (MinIO, etc.)
- **Azure Blob** (`az://`) - Microsoft Azure Blob Storage with full authentication support

## ðŸ“¦ Architecture & Binaries

- **`io-bench`** - Single-node CLI for immediate testing across all backends
- **`iobench-agent`** - Distributed gRPC agent for multi-node load generation  
- **`iobench-ctl`** - Controller for coordinating distributed agents
- **`iobench-run`** - Dedicated workload runner (legacy, being integrated)

## ðŸŽŠ Latest Release (v0.3.1) - Enhanced User Experience

### âœ¨ Progress Bars & Visual Feedback
- **Interactive Progress Bars**: Professional real-time progress visualization for all operations
- **Time-based Progress**: Smooth animated progress tracking for timed workloads with ETA
- **Operation Progress**: Visual completion tracking for GET, PUT, DELETE commands  
- **Smart Messages**: Dynamic progress context showing concurrency, data sizes, and rates
- **Enhanced Default Output**: Better feedback without requiring verbose flags

### ðŸŽ¯ Core Features (v0.3.0)

- **Complete Multi-Backend Support**: Unified interface across file://, direct://, s3://, and az:// protocols
- **Microsecond Precision Metrics**: HDR histogram performance measurements with Âµs accuracy
- **Four Operation Categories**: GET, PUT, LIST, STAT, DELETE with dedicated latency tracking
- **Advanced Glob Patterns**: Cross-backend wildcard support for flexible object selection
- **Azure Blob Storage**: Full Azure authentication and proper URI format support
- **Enhanced Configuration**: Target-based YAML configs with environment variable support
- **Distributed Architecture**: gRPC agent/controller for multi-node load generation
- **Real-Time Performance**: Validated 25k+ ops/s file operations, network-dependent cloud performance

### ðŸš€ Quick Start

```bash
# Install and build
cargo build --release

# Test local filesystem
./target/release/io-bench health --uri "file:///tmp/test/"
./target/release/io-bench put --uri "file:///tmp/test/data.txt" --object-size 1024

# Test Azure Blob Storage (requires setup)
export AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT="your-storage-account"
export AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY="your-account-key"
./target/release/io-bench health --uri "az://your-storage-account/container/"

# Run distributed workload
./target/release/iobench-agent --listen 127.0.0.1:7761 &
./target/release/iobench-ctl --insecure --agents 127.0.0.1:7761 ping
```

### ðŸ“Š Performance Characteristics

- **File Backend**: 25k+ ops/s, sub-millisecond latencies
- **Direct I/O Backend**: 10+ MB/s throughput, ~100ms latencies  
- **Azure Blob Storage**: 2-3 ops/s, ~700ms latencies (network dependent)
- **Cross-Backend Workloads**: Mixed protocol operations in single configuration

### ðŸ”§ Requirements

- **Rust**: Stable toolchain (2024 edition)
- **Protobuf**: `protoc` compiler for gRPC (distributed mode)
- **Storage Credentials**: Backend-specific authentication (AWS, Azure)

See the [Usage Guide](docs/USAGE.md) for detailed setup instructions.
- **Microsecond Precision**: Sub-millisecond timing accuracy for detailed performance analysis
- **Verbose Logging**: `-v` for operational info, `-vv` for detailed debug tracing
- **Pattern Matching**: Glob patterns (`*`) and directory listings supported across backends
- **Concurrent Execution**: Semaphore-controlled concurrency with configurable worker counts

### Technical Notes
**Stage 2 Migration Complete** - Successfully migrated all operations from direct AWS SDK calls to ObjectStore trait. Multi-backend file:// and direct:// URIs now fully operational alongside S3, with comprehensive logging and performance validation. Ready for production testing across all supported backends.
