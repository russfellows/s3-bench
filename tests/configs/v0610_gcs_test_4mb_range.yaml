# v0.6.10 GCS Test: 4MB objects, RangeEngine ENABLED
# Purpose: Test if concurrent range requests help with 4MB objects
#
# Configuration:
# - min_split_size: 4 MiB (force splitting on our 4MB objects)
# - chunk_size: 4 MiB (single chunk per 4MB object, tests if splitting helps at all)
# - max_concurrent_ranges: 8

target: "gs://YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/sai3bench-test-4mb/"
duration: 60s
concurrency: 64

range_engine:
  enabled: true
  min_split_size: 4194304      # 4 MiB - force range splitting
  chunk_size: 4194304          # 4 MiB chunks (whole object as one range request)
  max_concurrent_ranges: 8
  range_timeout_secs: 30

    weight: 100

# Expected: May be FASTER than baseline if:
# - Network latency is high (>50ms)
# - 2 concurrent 2MB requests < 1 sequential 4MB request
# Expected: May be SLOWER if:
# - Range request overhead dominates
# - Network is already saturated
