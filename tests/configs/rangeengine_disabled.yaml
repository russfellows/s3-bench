# RangeEngine Configuration Test - Disabled
#
# This config tests workload with RangeEngine DISABLED for baseline comparison.
# Purpose: Measure performance without concurrent range requests.
#
# Expected behavior:
# - All GET operations use simple sequential downloads
# - No HEAD requests for file size detection
# - Baseline latency for comparison with enabled config
#
# How to use:
# 1. Prepare test data (same as enabled test):
#    sai3-bench prepare --config tests/configs/rangeengine_disabled.yaml
#
# 2. Run workload:
#    sai3-bench -vv run --config tests/configs/rangeengine_disabled.yaml
#
# 3. Compare results with rangeengine_enabled.yaml
