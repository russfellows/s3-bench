# v0.6.10 GCS Test: 16MB objects, RangeEngine with 8MB chunks
# Purpose: Test if 16MB objects benefit from larger chunks
#
# Configuration:
# - min_split_size: 16 MiB
# - chunk_size: 8 MiB (2 chunks per object - reduced overhead)

# Old wisdom: 16MB was minimum for RangeEngine due to HEAD overhead
# New test: Is 16MB still optimal, or can we go lower?
