# v0.6.9 Benchmark: Read 1TB using direct:// with 8MB files (chunked reads)
# Tests v0.6.9's chunked read optimization with files that trigger chunking
# Usage: sai3-bench run --config v069_benchmark_read_direct_8mb.yaml
#
# This reads 131,072 8MB files using direct I/O with chunked reads:
# - Files are 8 MB (exactly at CHUNKED_READ_THRESHOLD)
# - v0.6.9: Uses 4 MiB chunks (2 reads per file)
# - v0.6.8: Uses whole-file reads (1 read per file, slow)
#
# Expected: Significant performance improvement in v0.6.9 vs v0.6.8
