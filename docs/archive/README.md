## Why Archived?

These documents served important purposes during development and release:
- Implementation planning and tracking
- Detailed testing methodology and results
- Version-specific performance analysis

However, they:
- Created clutter in the main docs directory
- Contained implementation details of interest mainly to developers at that point in time
- Have been superseded by comprehensive feature guides that span multiple releases
