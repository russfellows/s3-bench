# v0.6.10 GCS Test: 4MB objects, RangeEngine DISABLED (baseline)
# Purpose: Establish baseline performance with simple GET requests
# 
# Expected behavior with v0.6.10:
# - Pre-stat phase: Concurrent HEAD for all objects (~200ms for 1000 objects)
# - Download phase: Simple GET requests (no range splitting)
# - get_optimized() uses cached sizes (no per-object HEAD)
#
# This is the control - should be faster than v0.6.9 due to eliminated HEAD overhead

target: "gs://YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/sai3bench-test-4mb/"
duration: 60s  # 1 minute test
concurrency: 64

# RangeEngine explicitly disabled
range_engine:
  enabled: false

workload:
  - op: get
    path: "data/*"
    weight: 100

# Test with objects prepared by: v0610_gcs_prepare_test_4mb.yaml
# Compare throughput and latency against v0.6.9 baseline
